"""XPU shims for upstream `torchtitan.experiments.rl/`.

Upstream `rl/` has two CUDA-specific touch points that need shimming
on Intel XPU (Aurora / Sunspot):

1. **`has_cuda_capability(9, 0)` checks** (referenced from
   `actors/generator.py:40,465` and `models/attention.py:20,70`).
   These gate FA3-vs-FA2 selection and a `block_size=256` override.
   XPU is "not Hopper" → take the FA2 / non-Hopper branch
   unconditionally. Monkey-patched in `torchtitan.tools.utils` so the
   real `attention.py` and `generator.py` see the patched version.

2. **`PerHostProvisioner`** in `train.py:45` — partitions GPUs across
   trainer/generator meshes by exporting `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`. The
   XPU equivalent for partitioning visibility is `ZE_AFFINITY_MASK`
   (Level Zero). Replaced wholesale in `ezpz/rl/train_upstream.py`.

We do NOT stub `models/attention.py` — vllm-xpu actually ships
`vllm.v1.attention.backends.flash_attn` (just like vllm-cuda does),
so the file imports cleanly. The custom `PyTorchVarlenAttentionBackend`
it registers is never selected by vllm-xpu (which uses
`AttentionBackendEnum.CUSTOM` only if explicitly chosen in EngineArgs),
so leaving the registration intact is harmless.

Used by `ezpz/rl/train_upstream.py` (the ezpz mirror of `rl/train.py`
that applies the patches before import-time triggers them).
